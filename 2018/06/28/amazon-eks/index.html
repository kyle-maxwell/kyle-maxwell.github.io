  <p>Imagine nearly 200 engineering teams, many of whom are looking for a solution to running container workloads in order to reduce 
operational complexity, manage orchestration and scale horizontally on the fly. What happens when they don’t have a common 
solution at hand? By nature, engineers will seek out a solution, evaluate, and then begin solving problems. There are a number 
of viable, useful and technically sound container runtime solutions out there. If these teams are operating independently, not 
every team will choose the same solution. The downside to this is that each of these solutions can be complex to operate and each 
has its own best practices. As teams grow, shrink, and shift, it becomes incrementally more difficult and expensive to keep
operating lots of different solutions over time, making it harder to combine efforts from various teams on particular projects, or 
to fold projects together under a common team. The risks of siloing knowledge of best practices and accumulating technical debt 
surrounding bespoke, single-case solutions are high.</p>

<p>A predictable and potentially viable way to solve this would be to attempt to break out our operation of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, the engine we chose, into a platform team and offer it to other teams “as a service.” This solves the 
problem of the diversity of solutions in play and focuses the technical expertise of operating a complex environment on one team. 
However, many problems remain.</p>

<p>Running an “as a service” container solution requires a solid definition of the platform’s responsibility versus the product 
teams’ responsibility. In an environment such as Kubernetes, it can be challenging to debug and optimize an application. This is 
because the problem space is split between the Kubernetes control plane (master nodes with their core context services, such as 
kube-controller-manager) and the worker nodes where the application runs. So, for example, if a particular high volume service is 
experiencing slow load times or intermittent interruptions, the solution might be to tune kube-controller-manager’s qps and burst 
settings or kube-apiserver’s max-requests-inflight. But the problem could also be in the application’s configuration or its pod 
runtime settings. It can be very difficult to divide up the responsibilities for the cluster between a platform team and the 
various application teams who are using it.  It can be even harder to do so in a way that can scale across an organization or 
across the company.</p>

<p>Operating such a service also requires an integrated authentication and authorization mechanism so that access to resources is 
appropriately gated. It requires an implementation of some kind of charge-back model so that the cost of the resources is shared 
among the teams using the solution. It requires the members of that platform team to be able to handle the issues generated by 
potentially hundreds of teams of engineers, to keep on top of the needs of those teams, to keep the compute infrastructure 
supporting those teams appropriately scaled, to make capital expenditures when the resource pool is deemed too thin, and more. A
fully funded platform effort could address all of these issues. But what if operating “as a service” infrastructures that span from
the resource and virtualization layer through the container runtime layer and all the way up to end-user applications and services
isn’t the main distinguishing feature of your business? What if you need your hundreds of teams of engineers to be focused on the
tooling and customer-facing products that differentiate your products from your competitors? In short, if your company’s primary 
mission isn’t running these on-premises “as a service” solutions, it’s difficult to justify the significant person time and 
investment that is needed to keep it running successfully for a large engineering organization.</p>

<p>Enter Amazon Web Services (AWS) and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks">Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS)</a>. As a 
foundation, AWS offers us the tools needed to track our expenditures, team by team, organization by organization, without having 
to completely implement our own model for managing expense. They provide us a clearly articulated Shared Responsibility Model that 
offloads many layers of operational responsibility to their own scaled-out support teams across all regions and services. In 
addition, they let us scale out our resources as-needed and with an operational expense model rather than a capital expenditure 
model which simplifies our process and lessens our risk of spending money where we don’t need to.</p>

<p>Kubernetes is a flexible, sophisticated tool for running workloads in a common way regardless of whether they are running in our 
on-premise infrastructure or on AWS. This gives us a simplified operational model for our software deployment and runtime 
management and monitoring and at the same time simplifies migration to AWS from our existing infrastructure. EKS in particular 
offers an enormous benefit to GoDaddy. Our engineers use Kubernetes in incredibly diverse ways. In particular, our usage divides 
up into four primary use cases:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Batch: event- or schedule-driven, finite duration jobs. An example is a security scan, which usually contains standard 
container model definitions and minimal operational complexity</li>
  <li>Small services: one-to-ten pod deployments with one container each, normally a traditional 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">LAMP</a>-style web service</li>
  <li>Big services: hundreds of pods with multiple containers, usually representing an entire microservices architecture tied back to 
a GoDaddy product line, such as a commerce system</li>
  <li>Massive, end-user containerized services: thousands-to-hundreds of thousands of pods per cluster, each with thousands of nodes 
and multiple containers per pod in a sophisticated end-user architecture</li>
</ol>

<p>As an example of the last, Managed WordPress 2.0 (MWP2) was developed on Kubernetes to produce managed, highly available WordPress 
sites that offer our users fantastic performance, scalability and flexibility. We solved problems with traditional shared hosting
implementations of WordPress by using containers and taking advantage of the overlay filesystem, giving flexibility to site owners 
to be on the versions of PHP and WordPress they want to be on. We used Kubernetes’ horizontal scaling capabilities and made good 
use of cachine to keep the performance of the WordPress system as high as possible.</p>

<p>But this is only one of many ways we are using this powerful container runtime and orchestration platform. We are also running 
sophisticated CICD pipelines, automating security scans, deploying and managing both internally and externally facing proxies and 
operating and scaling core customer services this way. Our Presence and Commerce systems, aftermarket DNS sales and core data 
application infrastructure are tested, built, deployed and scaled using Kubernetes.</p>

<p>Our four primary use cases for container workloads demand many different configurations, management, and scaling requirements on 
the Kubernetes clusters. EKS takes the operational complexity out of managing these clusters. First, it manages the scaling and 
coordination of the control plane’s core infrastructure, eliminating the need for GoDaddy to administer Kubernetes master nodes. 
Second, because of the deep integration of EKS with other AWS services, GoDaddy can leverage massive benefits from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/">Elastic Load 
Balancers</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/">auto-scaling</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/">AWS CloudTrail</a> logging, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">AWS Cloudwatch</a> monitoring, and event-driven 
programming using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>. Third, we can manage the Kubernetes worker infrastructure using 
GoDaddy’s best practices through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS CloudFormation</a>. AWS CloudFormation enables GoDaddy 
to define and deploy infrastructure as code, which is then used in conjunction with 
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/">AWS Service Catalog</a> to provide governance and best practices.</p>

<p>Getting started with EKS is simple. Before you begin, you should have kubectl and the Heptio Authenticator to allow IAM 
authentication for your Kubernetes cluster installed. In addition, you should have the AWS CLI installed and set up with 
credentials to access your account. Full instructions on setting up these prerequisites can be found in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html">Getting Started 
guide</a>.</p>

<p>There are two basic tasks involved in getting your AWS Kubernetes cluster up and running:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Get your cluster up: this is the control plane, including the Kubernetes masters and services, and</li>
  <li>Get your worker nodes up: this includes the EC2 instances you’ll be running your pods on</li>
</ol>

<p>To get your cluster going, you need nothing more than a VPC,
an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html">EKS role to associate with the cluster</a>, subnets 
selected from the VPC for your workers, and security groups for them to run under.  Using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/eks/index.html">AWS CLI</a>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>aws eks create-cluster \
  --name &lt;name of your cluster&gt; \
  --role-arn &lt;arn of the EKS role you created&gt; \
  --resources-vpc-config subnetIds=&lt;subnet id 1&gt;,&lt;subnet id 2&gt;,securityGroupIds=&lt;security group id 1&gt;,&lt;security group id 2&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Another way to do this is to use the AWS canonical CloudFormation template and create a stack with it:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name &lt;stack name&gt; \
  --template-url https://amazon-eks.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1.10.3/2018-06-05/amazon-eks-vpc-sample.yaml
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This option will create a new VPC with new subnets and security groups and launch the cluster there.  Note that the pricing of the
EKS control plane is $0.20/hour, so if you’re experimenting on a budget, be sure to keep track of how long your cluster is running.</p>

<p>The second set of things you’ll need for your cluster are <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-workers.html">the worker nodes</a>. Here, the current recommendation is to use another canonical AWS-developed CloudFormation stack definition 
to get going quickly.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name &lt;stack name&gt; \
  --template-url https://amazon-eks.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1.10.3/2018-06-05/amazon-eks-nodegroup.yaml
  --parameters \
    ParameterKey=ClusterName,ParameterValue=&lt;the name you gave your cluster&gt; \
    ParameterKey=ClusterControlPlaneSecurityGroup,ParameterValue=&lt;security group id 1&gt;,&lt;security group id 2&gt; \
    ParameterKey=NodeGroupName,ParameterValue=&lt;a name for your node group and the autoscaling group it is a part of&gt; \
    ParameterKey=NodeAutoScalingGroupMinSize,ParameterValue=&lt;autoscaling group minimum number of nodes&gt; \
    ParameterKey=NodeAutoScalingGroupMaxSize,ParameterValue=&lt;autoscaling group maximum number of nodes&gt; \
    ParameterKey=NodeInstanceType,ParameterValue=&lt;the instance type for your EC2 instances in the group&gt; \
    ParameterKey=VpcId,ParameterValue=&lt;the VPC id of your EKS cluster&gt; \
    ParameterKey=Subnets,ParameterValue=&lt;subnet id 1&gt;,&lt;subnet id 2&gt; \
    ParameterKey=KeyName,ParameterValue=&lt;the EC2 keypair for access via SSH to the EC2 nodes in your group&gt; \
    ParameterKey=NodeImageId,ParameterValue=&lt;the AMI ID for your EKS-optimized worker nodes&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The AMIs, which are based on Amazon Linux 2, are listed by region and can be found in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-workers.html">documentation for launching workers</a>.  After your cluster and workers are created and launched,
you must ensure your workers can join the cluster by applying a ConfigMap that will configure the cluster appropriately. You
can find complete instructions in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html">Getting Started guide</a>.</p>

<p>That’s all there is to it.  Within a few minutes, you can have a Kubernetes cluster integrated into your AWS account and ready
for your workloads.</p>

<p>Our engineering teams embrace the DevOps model, where they own the process of developing, operating and monitoring the 
infrastructure for their products in the same way that they develop their customer-facing applications. Using AWS Service Catalog 
as a product portfolio manager, GoDaddy can define standard settings for products with AWS CloudFormation definitions, enabling 
teams to iterate according to their own Service definitions within the boundaries that we determine to be both secure and 
performant. This approach lets GoDaddy apply centralized governance and help teams across the company, while still maintaining a 
path for radiating best practices and new knowledge out to the company.</p>

<p>Because GoDaddy hosts millions of domain names, websites and web services, we need an environment that scales to our needs while 
maintaining operational efficiency and minimizing complexity. EKS offers us an industry standard container runtime and 
orchestration engine that enables a clear path for migrating workloads from our on-premises infrastructure to AWS. It helps us 
simplify how we engineer and lets us focus on our ability to offer differentiated and delightful experiences for our customers, 
who look to GoDaddy to provide them the platform for creating and managing their independent ventures.</p>
